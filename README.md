To improve the bank account system using CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), Event Sourcing, and Kafka, here are some architectural considerations and design principles:

- Implement CQRS to separate the read and write responsibilities of the application. Commands are responsible for modifying the state of the system, while queries are responsible for reading data.
Event Sourcing:

- Use Event Sourcing to persist the state of the system as a sequence of events. Each event represents a change to the system's state and is stored in an event store.
Instead of directly modifying the state of the bank account, commands generate events that are appended to the event log. The state of the bank account is reconstructed by replaying these events.
Kafka Integration:

- Use Kafka as the message broker for distributing events between different components of the system.
Producers publish events to Kafka topics representing different types of commands or domain events.
Consumers subscribe to these topics to process the events and update the read and write models accordingly.


- Implement command handlers to process incoming commands. Command handlers validate the commands and generate corresponding domain events.
Publish the generated events to Kafka
